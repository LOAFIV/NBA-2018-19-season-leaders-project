# NBA-2018-19-season-leaders-project
I decided to webscrape and analyze the 2018/19 NBA season. I am a huge Golde State Warriors fan and we lost in the finals that year to the Toronto Raptors so i guess it still stings lol. I was able to pull data from the NBA stats website using the API. I cleaned and analyzed the data to find player correlations and usage. I then visualized some insights in a dashboard using Tableau.
